# Showlogin2 Plugin for Dokuwiki

## Description

This plugin shows the login dialog if you try to access a page you do not have rights for in case you are not logged in already.

It is a simple variant of the „Showlogin“ plugin by Oliver Geisen (http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:showlogin). This plugin shows the login dialog instead of the „access denied“ message, not in addition to it.

## License

This plugin is published under the Gnu Public License (GPL) V2.

## Installation

Unpack the file somewhere and move the directory named `showlogin2` into the `/lib/plugin` directory of your Dokuwiki installation.

## Notice

As this functionality is now built into Dokuwiki's core this plugin is obsolete (from Dokuwiki version 20140505 ["Ponder Stibbons"] upwards).
