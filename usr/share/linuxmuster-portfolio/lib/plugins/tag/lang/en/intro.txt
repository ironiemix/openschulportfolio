====== Tagindex Manager ======

This page allows you to rebuild the index used by the [[http://wiki.splitbrain.org/plugin:tag|Tag Plugin]].
This isn't needed generally as  the index builds and updates itself while
you tag your sites. However if you just upgraded, added or removed
a lot of files it may be a good idea to cleanup the the index.

This Manager needs a recent browser as it makes use of modern JavaScript
to carry out multiple tasks in the background (using [[wp>AJAX]]).

Rebuilding the index takes a long time. You should leave the page open
until the indexing has finished.

:!: Making a backup of ''data/index/tag.idx'' is recommended in case something goes wrong during rebuiling. :!:
